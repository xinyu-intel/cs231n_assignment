# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
===============

This repository contains python implementations of certain exercises from the Stanford CS class [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/). 

As of this writing I have yet completed the course material; completed assignments are marked [***done!***], otherwise they are as originally downloaded from the course site. Besides, datasets have been moved to another place in order to keep this repo lite.

Work in process.

* Assignment #1
 	* Q1: [k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (20 points)](https://github.com/xinyulab/cs231n_assignment/blob/master/assignment1/knn.ipynb) [***done!***]
 	* Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points) [***done!***]
 	* Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points) [***done!***]
 	* Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (25 points) [***done!***]
 	* Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (10 points) [***done!***]
 * Assignment #2
 	* Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (30 points) 
 	* Q2: Batch Normalization (30 points)
 	* Q3: Dropout (10 points)
 	* Q4: ConvNet on CIFAR-10 (30 points)
 * Assignment #3
 	* Q1: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs (40 points)
 	* Q2: Image Captioning with LSTMs (35 points)
 	* Q3: Image Gradients: Saliency maps and Fooling Images (10 points)
 	* Q4: Image Generation: Classes, Inversion, DeepDream (15 points)

 Finally, I do not guarantee that my solutions are correct, so if you spot any errors do let me know. Thank you!
